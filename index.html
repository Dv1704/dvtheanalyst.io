									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I undertook the crucial task of data cleaning for a housing dataset using the powerful Python library, Pandas. The primary objective was to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, setting a solid foundation for subsequent analysis. With meticulous attention to detail, I applied a systematic data cleaning process that encompassed handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing inconsistencies. Leveraging the extensive functionalities of Pandas, I effectively transformed the raw housing data into a clean and consistent format. This project demonstrates my expertise in utilizing Pandas for data cleaning, showcasing my ability to deliver high-quality datasets that drive accurate insights and informed decision-making.</p>
